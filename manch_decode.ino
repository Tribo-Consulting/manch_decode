/*

The usual setup() and loop() sketch is on the "main" tab

The way that the arduino ide currently link .ino files it is not possible to use namespaces.
To workaround this limitation, this file is kept intentionally blank.

Put the conventional setup and loop code on the "main" tab.
Everything that needs to be linked before the main sketch is named with a underscore "_name".

I hope this gets fixed =\
